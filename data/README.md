From winter to summer and back: lessons from the parameterisation of a seasonal food web model for the Bia&#322;owie&#380;a forest. (2020) Sauve A.M.C., Barraquand F.

This manuscript describes a workflow to parameterise a seasonal food web model for the Bia&#322;owie&#380;a forest (Poland).

It is structured with three folders:

* `Data` which gathers tables directly extracted from [J&#281;drzejewska & J&#281;drzejewski's book](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540641384) (1998) about predation in the Bia&#322;owie&#380;a forest. Other tables compile data from the same book (e.g., abundances, body masses).

* `Parameterisation` which gathers all R scripts (in `Parameterisation/Scripts`) to estimates model parameters.

* `Simulations` gathers MATLAB scripts to simulate the dynamics of our parameterised food web model of the Bia&#322;owie&#380;a forest.

* `Figures` contains R scripts to draw the figures displayed in the manuscript.
